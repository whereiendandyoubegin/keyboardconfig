## Keyboard config for Dactyl Manuform 6x6 (at the moment)
I kind of messed up the wiring so my pins are in a different order to what they should be.
I'll write a blog post soon to go through this with pictures.
The biggest pain was the keymap. You have to remember once you have the halves connected they're treated as one continuous keyboard so the rows have
to continue from one another. I spent a while pulling hair over this.
